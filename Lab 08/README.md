# Lab 08: Newton’s Divided & Forward Difference interpolation

## Tasks
### Task 1
- Construct a divided difference table for the following data using matlab.
- Using Newton’s Divided Difference formula, construct polynomials of degree **(i)** one  **(ii)** two  and **(iii)** three for the following data. Also interpolate value of y = 0.1 for in each case.

|x|y|
|--|--|
|-0.1|5.3|
|0.0|2.0|
|0.2|3.19|
|0.3|1.0|

### Task 2
- Construct a forward difference table for the following data using matlab.

|x|y|
|--|--|
|0.1|0.003|
|0.3|0.067|
|0.5|0.148|
|0.7|0.248|
|0.9|0.370|
|1.1|0.518|
|1.3|0.698|

- Interpolate value of y for x = 0.213.
- Construct Third degree interpolation polynomial using Newton’s Forward Difference Formula.
