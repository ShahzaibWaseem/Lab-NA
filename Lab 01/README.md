4.  We have the following two matrices

    B = [2 2 3; 4 0 6; 8 1 5]
    C = [1 1 2; 6 3 5; 1 9 1]
	
	Calculate:
	1. D = B - C
	2. E = B + C
	3. F= E+2
	4. G=BC
	5. H=Matrix whose entries are product of corresponding entries of B and C
	
5.  For the polynomial
f(x) = x<sup>5</sup> - 12x<sup>4</sup> + 40.59x<sup>3</sup> - 17.015x<sup>2</sup> - 71.95x + 35.88
Calculate f(9).
