(a) Get the matrix transpose.
(b) Divide A by 2.
\(c\) Get determinant of A.
(d) Get inverse of A if possible.
(e) Get 2nd column of A
(f) Get 4th row 0f A.

2.  Execute the following Functions. z = [0.9347,0.3835,0.5194,0.8310]
» max(z)
» min(z)
» sort(z)

4.  We have the following two matrices 
B = [2 2 3; 4 0 6; 8 1 5]
C = [1 1 2; 6 3 5; 1 9 1]
	
	Calculate:
	
	(a) D = B - C
	(b) E = B + C
	\(c\) F= E+2
	(d) G=BC
	(e) H=Matrix whose entries are product of corresponding entries of B and C
	
5.  For the polynomial
f(x) = x<sup>5</sup> - 12x<sup>4</sup> + 40.59x<sup>3</sup> - 17.015x<sup>2</sup> - 71.95x + 35.88
Calculate f(9).
Plot the polynomial for -1.5 ≤ x ≤ 6.7.
