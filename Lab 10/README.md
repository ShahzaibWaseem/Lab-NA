# Lab 10: Numerical Differentiation using Taylor Series

## Tasks

### Task 1
The following data was collected for the distance traveled verses time for a rocket.

|t|x|
|--|--|
|0|0|
|25|32|
|50|58|
|75|78|
|100|92|
|125|100|

- Estimate velocity at t=25 using two point forward difference formula/ forward difference formula of o(h).
- Estimate velocity at t=50 using three point central difference formula/central difference formula of o(h<sup>2</sup>).
- Estimate velocity at t=125 using three point backward difference formula/ difference formula of o(h).

### Task 2
Consider the following table of values.

|x|f(x)|
|--|--|
|0.5|0.4794|
|0.6|0.5646|
|0.7|0.6442|

- Estimate f'' (0.6) using central difference formula of o(h<sup>2</sup>).
- If f(x) = sin(x) then calculate error bound of central difference formula of o(h<sup>2</sup>).
