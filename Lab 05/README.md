# Lab 05: Regula Falsi Method and Fixed Point Method



## Tasks

- Implement Regula falsi method as function. Take function, initial guess, tolerance and other required parameter as input from user. find its roots.

f(x) = x - 2*(sin(x<sup>2</sup>))
 
- Implement fixed point method as function. Take function, initial guess, tolerance and other required parameter as input from user. find its roots.

f(x) = 2<sup>-x</sup>
