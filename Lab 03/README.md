# Lab 3: Bisection Method Using Function

## Task
The bisection method in mathematics is a root-finding method that repeatedly bisects an interval and then selects a subinterval in which a root must lie for further processing. It is a very simple and robust method, but it is also relatively slow.

Implement the **Bisection Method** using functions. 

- f(x) = x<sup>3</sup> + 4x<sup>2</sup> - 10
- f(x) = x<sup>3</sup> + x - 4
