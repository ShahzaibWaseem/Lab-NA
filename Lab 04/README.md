# Lab 04: Newton Raphson Method

## Instructions
For Newton Raphson Method the function must be differentiable.

The formula for Newton Raphson Method is: 

x<sub>i+1</sub> = x<sub>i</sub> - \frac{f(x<sub>i</sub>)}{f'(x<sub>i</sub>)}

## Tasks

Implement the **Newton Raphson** Method using functions. 

Take a function, initial guess and tolerance from the user and calculate its **derivative** and find its **roots**.

Use the Following Functions:

- f(x) = x<sup>3</sup> + 4x<sup>2</sup> - 10
- f(x) = x<sup>3</sup> + x - 4
