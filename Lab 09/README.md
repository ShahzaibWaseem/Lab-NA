# Lab 08: Derivatives using Newton’s Forward, Backward, Sterling’s Central Difference Interpolation Formula

## Tasks

### Task 1

Implement Stirling's Interpolation Formula for the following values. Interpolate value of y for x = 0.0.65.

|x|y|
|--|--|
|0.1|0.003|
|0.3|0.067|
|0.5|0.148|
|0.7|0.248|
|0.9|0.370|
|1.1|0.518|
|1.3|0.698|

### Task 2

Considering a uniform beam of one meter long simply supported at both ends, the bending moment is given by the following relation:

y'' = M(x)/EI

Where y(x) is the deflection, M(x) is the bending moment and EI is the flexural rigidity.

Calculate the bending moment at using Newton’s Forward Difference Formula

- using Newton’s Forward Difference Formula
- using Newton’s Backward Difference Formula,

assuming that the deflection distribution is among the following:

|x|y|
|--|--|
|0.0|0.0|
|0.2|7.78|
|0.4|10.68|
|0.6|8.37|
|0.8|3.97|
|1.0|0.0|
